Issue: 3E/motor related error during spin
Solution: Remove load, check for overloading or severe imbalance, power cycle, and attempt a small test load; contact service if error recurs.

---

Id: 23
Issue: Drum does not tumble in wash phase
Solution: Verify door lock engaged, reduce heavy loads, and restart cycle. If no movement across cycles, service may be needed.

---

Id: 24
Issue: Water left in detergent softener compartment
Solution: Lift out and clean the detergent drawer and siphon cap, remove residue, and reinstall correctly to restore proper flow.

---

---

Id: 28
Issue: Fabric softener not dispensing
Solution: Clean softener compartment and siphon, avoid thickened or expired softener, and ensure correct water pressure during rinse.

---

Id: 29
Issue: Washer displays Ub/UR balance code with small loads
Solution: Add a few extra items to stabilize the drum or select a lower spin speed; very small loads can cause imbalance.

---

Id: 30
Issue: Door gasket has mold spots
Solution: Clean gasket with a washer cleaner, run Drum Clean, dry the seal after use, and keep door ajar between cycles.

---
