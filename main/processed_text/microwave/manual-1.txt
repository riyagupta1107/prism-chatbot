Heating and standing times
When reheating food for the first time, it is helpful to make a note of the time
taken - for future reference.
Always make sure that the reheated food is piping hot throughout.
Allow food to stand for a short time after reheating - to let the temperature even out.
The recommended standing time after reheating is 2-4 minutes, unless another
time is recommended in the chart.
Take particular care when heating liquids and baby food. See also the chapter with
