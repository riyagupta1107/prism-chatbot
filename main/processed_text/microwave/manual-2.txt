dissipated within the food.
3. Cooking times vary according to the container used and the
properties of the food:
• Quantity and density
• Water content
• Initial temperature (refrigerated or not)
As the centre of the food is cooked by heat dissipation, cooking continues even when
you have taken the food out of the oven. Standing times specified in recipes and in this
booklet must therefore be respected to ensure:
• Even cooking of the food right to the centre.
• The same temperature throughout the food.
