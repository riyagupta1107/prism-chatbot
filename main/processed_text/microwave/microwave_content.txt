Heating and standing times
When reheating food for the first time, it is helpful to make a note of the time
taken - for future reference.
Always make sure that the reheated food is piping hot throughout.
Allow food to stand for a short time after reheating - to let the temperature even out.
The recommended standing time after reheating is 2-4 minutes, unless another
time is recommended in the chart.
Take particular care when heating liquids and baby food. See also the chapter with
the safety precautions.

booklet must therefore be respected to ensure:
• Even cooking of the food right to the centre.
• The same temperature throughout the food.

• All adjustments or repairs must be done by a qualified technician.
Only use microwave-safe utensils. Do not use metallic containers, gold or silver

Remove wire twist ties. Electric arcing may occur.
Do not use the oven to dry papers or clothes.
Use shorter times for small amounts of food to prevent overheating or burning.
Keep the power cord and power plug away from water and heat sources.
To avoid the risk of explosion, do not heat eggs with shells or hard-boiled eggs. Do
not heat airtight or vacuum-sealed containers, nuts, tomatoes, etc.
Do not cover the ventilation slots with cloth or paper. This is a fire hazard. The

sufficiently.
Always use oven mitts when removing a dish.
Stir liquids halfway during heating or after heating ends and allow the liquid stand
at least 20 seconds after heating to prevent eruptive boiling.
Stand at arms length from the oven when opening the door to avoid getting
scalded by escaping hot air or steam.
Do not operate the oven when it is empty. The oven will automatically shut down
for 30 minutes for safety purposes. We recommend placing a glass of water inside
the oven at all times to absorb microwave energy in case the oven is started
accidentally.
Install the oven in compliance with the clearances in this manual. (See Installing
your microwave oven.)
Use caution when connecting other electrical appliances to sockets near the oven.

2. The microwaves are absorbed by the food up to
a depth of about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Cooking then
continues as the heat is dissipated within the food.
3. Cooking times vary according to the container used
and the properties of the food:
• Quantity and density
• Water content
• Initial temperature (refrigerated or not)
As the centre of the food is cooked by heat dissipation, cooking continues
even when you have taken the food out of the oven. Standing times
specified in recipes and in this booklet must therefore be respected to
ensure:
• Even cooking of the food right to the centre
• The same temperature throughout the food
