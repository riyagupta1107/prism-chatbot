Setting the Temperature in Samsung Frost Free Refrigerator

General Temperature Ranges:
In the freezer, the temperature can be set from -15°C to -23°C.
In the fridge, the temperature can be set from 1°C to 7°C.

Recommended Seasonal Settings:

Winter Season: Set the freezer to -15°C and the fridge to 7°C.

Monsoon Season: Set the freezer to -19°C and the fridge to 3°C.

Summer Season: Set the freezer to -23°C and the fridge to 1°C.

Note on Vacation Mode:
Turn off Vacation mode if it's turned on, as it may cause a lack of cooling. To deactivate Vacation mode, you may need to press and hold the corresponding button for three seconds or press the Fridge button until the Vacation mode indicator turns off, depending on the model.

Smart Convertible (5 in 1) Refrigerator Modes
The Smart Convertible 5-in-1 Refrigerator, powered by Twin Cooling Plus technology, allows the freezer to convert into a fridge with five different modes.

Normal Mode: This is the default mode. The top compartment acts as a freezer and the lower compartment acts as a refrigerator. You can change the temperature settings as needed. The Freezer button sets the freezer temperature between -15°C and -23°C. The Fridge button sets the fridge temperature between 1°C and 7°C.

Seasonal Mode: This mode switches off the freezer when you don't need it, while the fridge continues to work. To set this mode, press and hold the Freezer Convert button for 3 seconds to enter selection mode, then press the Freezer Convert button again to select OFF mode.

Extra Fridge Mode: This mode converts the freezer into an additional fridge compartment for extra storage. Both top and bottom compartments will work as a fridge, maintaining a temperature between 1°C and 7°C. To set this mode, press and hold the Freezer Convert button for 3 seconds, then press the Freezer button again to select fridge mode.

Vacation Mode: This mode keeps the freezer ON while the fridge is switched to a low-power mode, maintaining a temperature of 17°C. To activate, press the Fridge button repeatedly until the Vacation indicator turns on. The fridge temperature display will turn off, but the freezer remains active.

Home Alone Mode: This mode is for when you don't have a lot to store. It switches off the main fridge compartment and converts the freezer section into a fridge. To activate, press the Fridge button repeatedly until the Home Alone indicator turns on, then press and hold the Freezer Convert button for 3 seconds.

Adjusting the Freezer Temperature with a Controller Knob:

If food in the refrigerator is frozen (typically during winter), set the Freezer temperature controller to a scale of 1 to 3.

When the room temperature is high (typically during summer), set the Freezer temperature controller to a scale of 8 to 9.

When the room temperature is normal (spring or autumn), set the controller to the "Normal" position.

Troubleshooting: Refrigerator Panel or Touch Screen Not Working

1. Check if the Panel is Locked:
The most common cause is the lock feature being engaged (e.g., Child Lock, Control Lock).

For SBS refrigerator model RS554NRUA, press and hold the Child Lock button for three seconds to activate or deactivate it.

For French Door refrigerator model RF858Q/RFG, press and hold the Lighting button for three seconds to activate or deactivate the Child Lock.

2. Power Cycle the Refrigerator:
Unplug the refrigerator or turn off the power at the circuit breaker for 60 seconds, then restore power. For Family Hub models, use the dedicated power switch located at the inside top of the top-right door.

3. Request Service:
If the issue persists, visit the Support Center to request service.

Refrigerator Functions

Power Cool Function:
The Power Cool feature quickly chills food. With one touch, cold air is blown into the fridge to temporarily lower the interior temperature to 1°C, keeping food fresher for longer and rapidly chilling drinks.

Solving No Cooling Issues:
For information on how to solve no cooling issues, please refer to official Samsung support documentation.

Moisture Prevention Tips

1. Placement of Refrigerator:

Keep the refrigerator away from direct sunlight.

Allow sufficient space for air flow: a minimum of 300 mm of free space at the sides, 150mm at the back, and at least 300mm at the top.

Do not place the refrigerator directly in front of an air cooler, under a fan, or in a high humidity area.

2. Correct Temperature Settings for Monsoon Season:

Frost Free / Side by Side: Keep the freezer at -19°C and the fridge at 3°C.

Direct Cool: Keep the temperature control knob between 3 and 4.

Digi-touch Cool: Keep the control level at 3 or 4, the Monsoon position.

3. Food and Utensil Placement:

Store food in an organized manner to ensure adequate air circulation.

Do not place hot food directly inside; let it cool to room temperature first.

Use mesh bags to store fruits and vegetables.

Always keep food covered with a lid.

4. Avoid Using Covers:

Using shelf covers may block air circulation.

Do not use external covers on top of refrigerators.

5. Door Usage:

Make sure the refrigerator door is properly closed to prevent warm air from entering.

Avoid frequent opening of the refrigerator door.
