2. The microwaves are absorbed by the food up to
a depth of about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Cooking then
continues as the heat is dissipated within the food.
3. Cooking times vary according to the container used
and the properties of the food:
• Quantity and density
• Water content
• Initial temperature (refrigerated or not)
As the centre of the food is cooked by heat dissipation, cooking continues
even when you have taken the food out of the oven. Standing times
specified in recipes and in this booklet must therefore be respected to
ensure:
• Even cooking of the food right to the centre
• The same temperature throughout the food
