• All adjustments or repairs must be done by a qualified technician.
Only use microwave-safe utensils. Do not use metallic containers, gold or silver
trimmed dinnerware, skewers, etc.
Remove wire twist ties. Electric arcing may occur.
Do not use the oven to dry papers or clothes.
Use shorter times for small amounts of food to prevent overheating or burning.
Keep the power cord and power plug away from water and heat sources.
To avoid the risk of explosion, do not heat eggs with shells or hard-boiled eggs. Do
not heat airtight or vacuum-sealed containers, nuts, tomatoes, etc.
Do not cover the ventilation slots with cloth or paper. This is a fire hazard. The
oven may overheat and turn off automatically and will remain off until it cools
sufficiently.
Always use oven mitts when removing a dish.
Stir liquids halfway during heating or after heating ends and allow the liquid stand
at least 20 seconds after heating to prevent eruptive boiling.
Stand at arms length from the oven when opening the door to avoid getting
scalded by escaping hot air or steam.
Do not operate the oven when it is empty. The oven will automatically shut down
for 30 minutes for safety purposes. We recommend placing a glass of water inside
the oven at all times to absorb microwave energy in case the oven is started
accidentally.
Install the oven in compliance with the clearances in this manual. (See Installing
your microwave oven.)
Use caution when connecting other electrical appliances to sockets near the oven.
