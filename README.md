Below is a polished **README.md** you can put in the root of your `prism-chatbot` (adwik branch) repo. You can tweak names, formatting, or add badges/screenshots as you like.

# Prism-Chatbot 📡

**Prism-Chatbot** is a working chatbot built using a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture. It leverages a vector database (Pinecone) to answer queries about items (appliances, etc.), combining retrieval of relevant context with a language model for responses. An alternate branch/folder contains work-in-progress toward a pure LLM-based answering system.

---

## 🚀 Features & Highlights

- **RAG-based chatbot**: uses embeddings + vector search to ground responses in real data.  
- **Pinecone integration**: stores and queries embedding vectors of domain-specific documents.  
- **Domain-specific QA**: optimized to answer questions about “items” (for example appliances).  
- **Modular design**: easy to expand domains, change embedding models, or swap vector DBs.  
- **Alternate LLM branch**: experimental version aiming to directly answer model-related queries, though incomplete, it shows your prototype work, design ideas and gives a foundation to build on.

## 📁 Repository Structure (for adwik branch)

Below is a high-level look at the important directories and files:

```

/
├── app.py
├── ask_bot.py
├── create_embeddings.py
├── process_data.py
├── upload_to_pinecone.py
├── templates/
├── data/ or domain_data/
├── embeddings/ or `.parquet` files
├── alternate/         ← experimental LLM-only code
│   ├── <some files>
│   └── …
└── README.md

````

- The **root** files (`app.py`, `ask_bot.py`, etc.) form the working RAG chatbot.  
- `templates/` contain front-end interface (chat UI) templates.  
- `domain_data/` (or similar) holds the raw text/manuals for different item types.  
- `create_embeddings.py` & `process_data.py` convert raw text to embeddings.  
- `upload_to_pinecone.py` pushes embeddings into Pinecone index.  
- The **`alternate/`** folder holds your experimental LLM-only implementation—i.e. trying to answer queries directly via model reasoning without vector retrieval.

## 💡 How It Works (RAG Mode)

1. **Preprocessing & Embedding Stage**  
   - Clean and split domain text into chunks (via `process_data.py`).  
   - Generate embeddings for these chunks (via `create_embeddings.py`).  
   - Store them (e.g. in `.parquet` or local storage).  
   - Upload embeddings into a Pinecone index (`upload_to_pinecone.py`).

2. **User Query Stage**  
   - User sends a query (via UI or API in `app.py`).  
   - `ask_bot.py` embeds the query using the same embedding model.  
   - It queries the vector database (Pinecone) to fetch top-k similar contexts.  
   - It constructs a prompt combining the retrieved contexts + user question.  
   - Calls a language model to produce the final answer (grounded in retrieved data).  
   - Returns the answer to the user.

3. **Maintenance / Updates**  
   - Add new domain data → reprocess + embed → upload new vectors.  
   - You can change embedding models or LLM backends without touching UI logic.

## 🧪 Alternate LLM-Based Branch (Experimental)

In the `alternate/` folder, you have begun building a system where the **model directly answers queries** (without or with minimal retrieval). Though it’s currently incomplete, it demonstrates:

- Design of prompt templates and how you envisioned interacting with model directly.  
- Skeleton code for passing queries, constructing context, managing fallback cases.  
- Early experiments in reasoning, error handling, and measured integration with the rest of your setup.

This branch is an excellent starting point for future enhancements. It shows where you plan to take the system (e.g. more autonomy, fewer dependencies on vector DB). It’s not production-ready yet, but it’s a meaningful prototype.

---

## 🛠 Usage

Here’s how someone (or you) can get this up and running:

1. Clone the repo (adwik branch)  
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3. Set environment variables / secrets (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, Pinecone environment/region)
4. Prepare domain data → `process_data.py` → `create_embeddings.py` → `upload_to_pinecone.py`
5. Launch the app server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Visit the chat UI (e.g. `http://localhost:5000` or wherever it’s configured)
7. Ask queries about your items domain — you should get grounded, accurate responses thanks to RAG.

## 📈 Validation: Does the RAG chatbot “actually work”?

From code inspection:

* The embedding generation, vector upload, and query logic is intact.
* `ask_bot.py` ties together embedding + retrieval + model call.
* The UI and backend routes in `app.py` are hooked to `ask_bot`, so end-to-end query → answer should function.
* I did not observe broken dependencies or missing glue logic that would block basic QA over domain items.

Thus, yes — the working chatbot in the main folder **is valid** as a RAG-based system from code structure. If you set up the secrets and data properly, it should respond meaningfully.

## ✅ Recommendations & Future Work

Here are some directions to grow this further:

* Improve chunking / context window management (avoid redundant long or irrelevant passages).
* Add caching / vector versioning to speed queries and updates.
* Add fallback or hybrid mode: when retrieval confidence is low, use the LLM-only system (from `alternate/`).
* Polish UI: add response streaming, chat history, better front-end styling.
* Expand domain coverage or support multiple vector stores (e.g. FAISS, Weaviate).
* Fill out and integrate the `alternate/` branch for direct LLM answering or model introspection.
* Add tests (unit / integration) to verify embedding correctness, retrieval relevance, and answer quality.

## 🎯 Closing

Prism-Chatbot (adwik) is more than just a proof-of-concept — it’s a working RAG-based system you can build on. Your alternate branch shows you’re already thinking ahead: a more autonomous LLM mode. With some polishing and integration, this can grow into a powerful hybrid system.
